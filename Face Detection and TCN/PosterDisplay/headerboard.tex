% Language, Encoding and Fonts
% http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Internationalization
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Select encoding of your inputs. Depends on
% your operating system and its default input
% encoding. Typically, you should use
%   Linux  : utf8 (most modern Linux distributions)
%            latin1 
%   Windows: ansinew
%            latin1 (works in most cases)
%   Mac    : applemac
% Notice that you can manually change the input
% encoding of your files by selecting "save as"
% an select the desired input encoding. 
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% Make latex understand and use the typographic
% rules of the language used in the document.
\usepackage[english]{babel}
% Use the vector font Latin Modern which is going
% to be the default font in latex in the future.
\usepackage{helvet}
% Change the default font family from roman to sans serif
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault} % for text
\usepackage[helvet]{sfmath} % for math
% Choose the font encoding
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% You cannot use floats in the baposter theme.
% We therefore load the caption package which provides
% the command \captionof
% Set up how figure and table captions are displayed
\usepackage{caption}
\captionsetup{
  font=small,% set font size to footnotesize
  labelfont=bf % bold label (e.g., Figure 3.2) font
}
% Make the standard latex tables look so much better
\usepackage{array,booktabs}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Mathematics
% http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Defines new environments such as equation,
% align and split 
\usepackage{amsmath}
% Adds new math symbols
\usepackage{amssymb}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Colours
% http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Colors
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\selectcolormodel{RGB}
% define the three aau colors
\definecolor{aaublue1}{RGB}{5,5,5}% dark blue
\definecolor{aaublue2}{RGB}{5,5,5} % light blue
\definecolor{aaublue3}{RGB}{5,5,5} % lighter blue
\definecolor{blackcolor}{RGB}{5,5,5} % lighter blue

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  noitemsep,% remove space between items
  labelindent=\parindent,% set the label indentation to the paragraph indentation
  leftmargin=*,% remove the left margin
  font=\color{aaublue1}\normalfont, %set the colour of all bullets, numbers and descriptions to aaublue1
}
% use set<itemize,enumerate,description> if you have an older latex distribution
\setitemize[1]{label={\raise1.25pt\hbox{$\blacktriangleright$}}}
